## Notice

I have to take Repauto down from GitHub for various reasons. One of them being
it was originally tailored for our internal use at Fiserv. The legacy code base
makes it difficult to evolve in a generic way. We still use it internally so it
is not easy to make it both tailored and generic at the same time. So I decided
to make Repauto an internal software only. A [new open sourced version of the
software](https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/testmon) is under development. It is a rewrite of Repauto which makes it
flexible, and also with powerful features inherited from Repauto. It is still 
in a very early stage.

## Repauto
